                    for 3 years, I am now going through a training course at Code Nation where I am looking to broaden my knowledge
                    and gather as much information as I can to help me progress and have a better future.

                <p>We have so far gone through:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>Git</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                    </ul>
                    We have a good few months to go through so much more and I cannot wait to see what is to come.
